	<h3>Hi there!</h3>
	<p>This site is a webhook proxy for CircleCI.  It will only allow webhooks matching rules all others will be silently ignored.</p>
	<h4>Rule: Forked PR Filter</h4>
	<p>Currently the only rule.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Only filters Forked PRS, pushes and same-repo PRS all build as normal</li>
		<li>Forked PRs are checked for the label provided in URL</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Replace your webhook with <pre>http://buildbully.cfapps.io/check_for_label/LABEL</pre> <img src="/static/images/webhook.png" /></p>
	<p>Only PRs that have had the label applied will be passed to CircleCI for processing. <br/><img src="/static/images/pr_summary.png" /></p>
	<p><Strong>Caveat</Strong>: Due to CirceCIC event processing, contributors will need to make an additional commit <em>after</em> the label is applied. <br/><img src="/static/images/caveat.png" /></p>
